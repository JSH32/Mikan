     * This is the first MBC chip for the gameboy. Any newer MBC chips are working similiar, so that is relative easy to
     * upgrade a program from one MBC chip to another - or even to make it compatible to several different types of MBCs.
     * Note that the memory in range 0000-7FFF is used for both reading from ROM, and for writing to the MBCs Control
     * Registers.
     * 
     * 0000-3FFF - ROM Bank 00 (Read Only)
     * This area always contains the first 16KBytes of the cartridge ROM.
     * 
     * 4000-7FFF - ROM Bank 01-7F (Read Only)
     * This area may contain any of the further 16KByte banks of the ROM, allowing to address up to 125 ROM Banks
     * (almost 2MByte). As described below, bank numbers 20h, 40h, and 60h cannot be used, resulting in the odd amount of
     * 125 banks.
     * 
     * A000-BFFF - RAM Bank 00-03, if any (Read/Write)
     * This area is used to address external RAM in the cartridge (if any). External RAM is often battery buffered,
     * allowing to store game positions or high score tables, even if the gameboy is turned off, or if the cartridge is
     * removed from the gameboy. Available RAM sizes are: 2KByte (at A000-A7FF), 8KByte (at A000-BFFF), and 32KByte (in
     * form of four 8K banks at A000-BFFF).
     * 
     * 0000-1FFF - RAM Enable (Write Only)
     * Before external RAM can be read or written, it must be enabled by writing to this address space. It is recommended
     * to disable external RAM after accessing it, in order to protect its contents from damage during power down of the
     * gameboy. Usually the following values are used:
     *   00h  Disable RAM (default)
     *   0Ah  Enable RAM
     * Practically any value with 0Ah in the lower 4 bits enables RAM, and any other value disables RAM.
     * 
     * 2000-3FFF - ROM Bank Number (Write Only)
     * Writing to this address space selects the lower 5 bits of the ROM Bank Number (in range 01-1Fh). When 00h is written,
     * the MBC translates that to bank 01h also. That doesn't harm so far, because ROM Bank 00h can be always directly
     * accessed by reading from 0000-3FFF. But (when using the register below to specify the upper ROM Bank bits), the same
     * happens for Bank 20h, 40h, and 60h. Any attempt to address these ROM Banks will select Bank 21h, 41h, and 61h
     * instead.
     * 
     * 4000-5FFF - RAM Bank Number - or - Upper Bits of ROM Bank Number (Write Only)
     * This 2bit register can be used to select a RAM Bank in range from 00-03h, or to specify the upper two bits (Bit 5-6)
     * of the ROM Bank number, depending on the current ROM/RAM Mode. (See below.)
     * 
     * 6000-7FFF - ROM/RAM Mode Select (Write Only)
     * This 1bit Register selects whether the two bits of the above register should be used as upper two bits of the ROM
     * Bank, or as RAM Bank Number.
     *   00h = ROM Banking Mode (up to 8KByte RAM, 2MByte ROM) (default)
     *   01h = RAM Banking Mode (up to 32KByte RAM, 512KByte ROM)
     * The program may freely switch between both modes, the only limitiation is that only RAM Bank 00h can be used during
     * Mode 0, and only ROM Banks 00-1Fh can be used during Mode 1.
